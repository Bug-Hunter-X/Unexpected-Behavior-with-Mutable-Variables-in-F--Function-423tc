This example demonstrates a common misunderstanding when using mutable variables in F# functions.  When passing mutable variables as arguments, they are passed by value, meaning that a copy of the reference is passed, not the reference itself.  Therefore, modifications inside the function do not affect the original variables outside the function scope. This readme describes and provides a solution for this issue.
